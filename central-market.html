        <h2>History of the Central Market</h2>

	<p>
	Located on Queen's Road Central, the Central Market is one of the oldest
	markets in Hong Kong, providing residents with everything from fresh
	food to daily essentials. The precursor of the Central Market was the
	Canton Bazaar, which opened in 1842 and moved to the current location of
	the market in the 1850s. The market was rebuilt in 1859 into a Victorian
	house with three stories, but was later demolished in 1937. A new market
	was constructed on the site in 1939 as a Bauhaus structure with four
	stories and 263 stalls in total. It was once the largest meat market in
	Southeast Asia, and was listed as a Grade III Historic Building in 1990.

        <h2>Modern Preservation Efforts</h2>
	
	<p>
	After the completion of the Mid-Levels Escalator in 1994, the upper
	levels of the Central Market were transformed into a shopping arcade.
	However, by 2000 the government had considered the market a waste of
	land due to its low usage, and it was closed in 2003. The Urban Renewal
	Authority announced a new preservation plan in the Chif Executive's
	Policy Address in 2007, and conducted community surveys and
	investigations on future uses of the Central Market between 2009 and
	2011. The final design plan was proposed in March 2016 and approved by
	the Town Planning Board after one year. The proposal includes 1,000
	square meters of open space for the public and 12,000 square meters for
	retail facilities. In 2017 the government handed the Central Market to
	the URA, allowing private operation and revitalization for the next 21
	years. The construction is still in progress and is estimated to be
	completed by 2022.
