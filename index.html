        <h2>What is the Smart Cultural Triangle Precinct?</h2>

        <p>
        The SCTP is the area between the Central Market, Tai Kwun (former
        Central Police Station complex), and PMQ (former Police Married
        Quarters) in the Central District of Hong Kong. The Institute for
        Sustainable Urbanisation (ISU) started the SCTP project in 2008 as an
        area-based conservation project aimed at preserving the historic and
        cultural heritage of this unique region.
        </p>

        <p>
        Numerous conservation efforts have already take place in the area,
        including the preservation of the Tai Kwun and PMQ. The Central Market's
        revitalization plan is still in progress, and it aims to be completed by
        2020.

        <h2>Cultural Triangle Location</h2>

	<div id="mapDiv" style="height: 400px; width: 100%;"></div>

        <p>
        The cultural triangle is located conveniently in the Central district, 
        on Hong Kong Island. All three sites are within a ten minute walk of 
        each other, and the area is bisected by the scenic Central–Mid-Levels 
        escalator. The Central Market is a quick five minute walk from Central
        Station west along Des Veoux Road Central.
        </p>

        <p>
        The SCTP is also bisected by the Central–Mid-Levels escalator, the
        longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world. This transport
        system/tourist attraction is lined with shops, restaurants, and markets,
        making it a nexus of Hong Kong culture.
