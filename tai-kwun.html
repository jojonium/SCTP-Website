        <h2>History of the Central Police Station</h2>

        <p>
        One of the first things built by the British when they took control of
        Hong Kong in 1841 was the Central Police Station and Victoria Prison.
        This compound was used for many purposes throughout the end of the 19th
        century and most of the 20th century. Throughout the 1900s there were
        many renovations of the prison, expanding it. After World War II it
        turned into an Immigration Department office and was processing many
        illegal immigrants and refugees from Vietnam around the 1980s.
        </p>

        <p>
        But by 2006 the prison and the police station were turned into a
        historic site and were no longer being used for their original purposes.
        Today the compound that consists of the Central Police Station, Victoria
        Prison and the Former Central Magistracy is now restored and parts have
        been turned into an arts complex. The restoration took a total of eight
        years and includes all the cells in Victoria Prison, signs and brick
        work on the outside of the building and many rooms within the buildings,
        all meant to show what the buildings originally looked like.  The new
        “art complex” includes a mix of contemporary and modern styles made from
        concrete and glass that stand out from the old brickwork of the original
        prison and police station.

        <h2>Modern Preservation Efforts</h2>
        
        <p>
        The Central Police Station (CPS) Compound has been renovated and put
        into reuse, as a newly developed complex referred to as Tai Kwun.
        Although the CPS compound was officially announced as an historic
        monument in 1995, the great economic potential brought by its superior
        location in the Central District caused conflicts between the local
        residents and developers in 2003. In order to boost Hong Kong’s economy
        in 2001, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, changed the
        CPS compound from the public-community-used zone into the specific uses
        zone. It was marked as a “historical building preserved for cultural,
        community, and commercial uses”. The Hong Kong government announced the
        plan for private tender of the CPS compound in April 2003. As public
        concern for heritage preservation rose, the government’s plan was
        criticized by many local people. The plan was shelved in 2004 when a
        group of wealthy people, the Hotung Group, proposed a different plan,
        which focused more on preserving culture rather than making profit. They
        received increasing attention and support from locals and the press when
        they proposed a HK$500 million donation for this proposal. From 2003 to
        2007 a heritage preservation group was formed, and surveys of public
        opinion were conducted under the goal of preserving historic sites.
        </p>

        <p>
        In April 2007 the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) proposed a revitalization
        plan and a donation to the government. This proposal was accepted by the
        government and announced in the 2007 Policy Address. The government
        became the partner of HKJC after three months, and they worked together
        to promote the preservation plan. Public opinion and designs for the
        buildings were collected over the next six months. In October 2010 the
        revised design of the CPS compound project was announced, and
        construction started in 2011 and continued for five years.Today the Tai
        Kwun is reopened with sixteen restored buildings after eleven years of
        work done by HKJC and visited by both locals and tourists.
