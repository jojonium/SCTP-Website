        <h2>History of the PMQ</h2>

        <p>
	The Police Married Quarters (PMQ) was originally the grounds of a
	government school. This school provided a western style education to
	some residents at primary and secondary levels and was temporarily
	relocated and later called Queen's College. During World War II the
	building was destroyed, and it had to be demolished after the war. In
	1951 the British government constructed the Police Married Quarters at
	this site. The police needed a building to house the high ranking,
	married police officers because space was so limited in the city. In
	total it contained around 140 single rooms and 28 double rooms.
	</p>

	<p>
	By 2000 the building was no longer being used and started to go into a
	state of decay. in 2009 the PMQ was one of eight projects to be
	preserved under "Conserving Central" policy. In recent years most of the
	site of the former Police Married Quarters has been turned into
	commercial space.

        <h2>Modern Preservation Efforts</h2>
        
        <p>
	The PMQ has been renovated and put into reuse, and now serves as a
	creative industries landmark. Similar to 
	<a href="tai-kwun" class="in-text-link">Tai Kwun</a>, as public concern
	for historic sites rose the Antiquities and Monuments office conducted
	surveys and investigations of the PMQ from 2005 to 2007. The AMO listed
	the PMQ as a Grade III Historic Building in 2010 due to the discovery of
	walls and quoin stones from the original structure. The Government
	collected public opinion in 2008 and decided to revitalize the PMQ with
	the following principles:
        </p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Preserving the historical relics;</li>
	  <li>Manifesting the heritage values and original ambience of the
		  Site;</li>
	  <li>Revitalizing the Site by giving it a new lease on life that may
		  become a landmark for local residents and visitors;</li>
	  <li>Contributing to the holistic planning of the Hollywood Road area
		  under the proposed "spot, line and area" approach for heritage
		  conservation and the promotion of heritage tourism;</li>
	  <li>Responding to the community's concerns about over development in
		  the area; and</li>
	  <li>Addressing the community's aspirations for more POS [public
		  space]</li>
	</ol>

        <p>
	The Legislative Council approved the funding and design for the PMQ in
	2011. The Construction started in January 2012, and The Musketeers
	Foundation completed the construction after two years. The Foundation
	also had support from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Hong Kong
	Design Centre, and the Hong Kong Design Institute of the Vocational
	Training Council. Now over a hundred designer studios, enterprises, and
	exhibitions in PMQ attract both locals and tourists.
